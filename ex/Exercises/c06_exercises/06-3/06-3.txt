A Person class containing their name, phone number, address, list of recent orders, loyalty card number, salary, employee id, job title (like engineer, senior engineer, ...) is combining too much into a single class. This can be split up into more logical concepts. One option is as follows:
- The Person class only stores their name, phone number, and address, things that are really direct properties of a person.
- A Customer class derives from Person and additionally stores a list of recent orders, loyalty card number, things that are more linked to a customer.
- An Employee class also derives from Person and stores a salary, employee ID, and title, things that are more linked to an employee.
