# Professional C++, 5th Edition - Sample Code and Exercises (Update March 2022)

This is a Git/GitHub Repository working through the code and exercise provided by the publisher and modified as I dived in the book as customizing and testing the code with a Git log available if cloned.

It is meant to serve as a tested and improved guide in each of the topics covered for the latest available standard.

## Prerequisites and Dependencies
* cmake >= 3.22
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  * Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source.
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
